# DMD
This repository consists of code written in C++ (and using the OpenGL API) for the Chin Lab for Ultracold Atomic and Molecular Physics. Based on a routing algorithm, the code dynamically generates and renders image frames designed to be displayed on a digital micromirror device (DMD), thus controlling optical tweezers that move atoms on a triangular lattice.
